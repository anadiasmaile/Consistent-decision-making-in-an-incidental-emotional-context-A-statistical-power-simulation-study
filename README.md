 This repository consists of the R scripts used for the statistical power simulation study

# A planned study is going to investigate the impact of an incidental emotional context on decision making under risk. The present study sought to enable a quality experimental design for this. Both sample size and effect size were evaluated to ensure a good statistical power. Three statistical power simulations were conducted for this. The language and environment for statistical computing, called R, was used. This repository consists of the used scripts.

#statistical-power-simulation-1
#The impact of a varying sample size on the statistical power was simulated. The files "utilities_sample_size.R" and "power_simulation_sample_size.R" must be saved in the same folder. Then the power simulation can be conducted by running the file "power_simulation_sample_size.R".

#statistical-power-simulation-2
#The given effect size was calculated with the file "estimate_effect_size.R".
#The impact of a varying e_pos on the mean CCEI of decisions across frames for the positive emotional context group was simulated. The files "utilities_e_pos.R" and "mean_simulation_e_pos.R" must be saved in the same folder. Then the simulation can be conducted by running the file "mean_simulation_e_pos.R".
#The impact of a varying e_pos on the statistical power was simulated. The files "utilities_effect_size.R" and "power_simulation_effect_size.R" must be saved in the same folder. Then the simulation can be conducted by running the file "power_simulation_effect_size.R".

#statistical-power-simulation-3
#The statistical power of the PANAS was estimated in branch called PANAS. For the positive affect scale the files "utilities_positive_affect.R" and "power_simulation_positive_affect.R" must be saved in the same folder. Then the simulation can be conducted by running the file "power_simulation_positive_affect.R". For the negative affect scale the files "utilities_negative_affect.R" and "power_simulation_negative_affect.R" must be saved in the same folder. Then the simulation can be conducted by running the file "power_simulation_negative_affect.R".
#The statistical power of the Visual Analogue Mood Scale was estimated in branch called Visual Analogue Mood Scale. The files "utilities_VAMS.R" and "power_simulation_VAMS.R" must be saved in the same folder. Then the simulation can be conducted by running the file "power_simulation_VAMS.R".
