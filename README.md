# Consistent-decision-making-in-an-incidental-emotional-context-A statistical-power-simulation-study
 This repository consists of the R scripts used for the statistical power simulation study

A planned study is going to investigate the impact of an incidental emotional context on decision making under risk. The present study aims to enable a quality experimental design for this. Both sample size and effect size were evaluated to ensure a good statistical power. Three statistical power simulations were conducted for this. The language and environment for statistical computing, called R, was used. This repository consists of the used scripts.

## Statistical power simulation 1
The impact of a varying sample size on the statistical power was simulated. The files "utilities_sample_size.R" and "power_simulation_sample_size.R" must be saved in the same folder. Then the power simulation can be conducted by running the file "power_simulation_sample_size.R".

## Statistical power simulation 2
The impact of a varying e_pos on the effect size was simulated. The files "utilities_e_pos.R" and "effect_size_e_pos.R" must be saved in the same folder. Then the simulation can be conducted by running the file "effect_size_e_pos.R".
Next the impact of a varying effect size on the statistical power was simulated. The files "utilities_effect_size1.R", "utilities_effect_size2.R" and "power_simulation_effect_size.R" must be saved in the same folder. Then the power simulation can be conducted by running the file "power_simulation_effect_size.R".

## Statistical power simulation 3
### PANAS
The statistical power of the PANAS was estimated. For the positive affect scale the files "utilities_positive_affect.R" and "power_simulation_positive_affect.R" must be saved in the same folder. Then the simulation can be conducted by running the file "power_simulation_positive_affect.R". For the negative affect scale the files "utilities_negative_affect.R" and "power_simulation_negative_affect.R" must be saved in the same folder. Then the simulation can be conducted by running the file "power_simulation_negative_affect.R".
### Visual Analogue Mood Scale
The statistical power of the Visual Analogue Mood Scale was estimated. The files "utilities_VAMS.R" and "power_simulation_VAMS.R" must be saved in the same folder. Then the simulation can be conducted by running the file "power_simulation_VAMS.R".
